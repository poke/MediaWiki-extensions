# MediaWiki extensions

This repository was originally used for extensions which have since been moved out into their own repositories:

* [AlternativeUserTalk](https://github.com/poke/mediawiki-AlternativeUserTalk)
* [ListTransclusions](https://github.com/poke/mediawiki-ListTransclusions)
* [RecentChangesLogFilter](https://github.com/poke/mediawiki-RecentChangesLogFilter)

The remainder of this repository is used for experiments which havenâ€™t been migrated into separate repositories yet.
